# Super-H emulator
This lib is intended to emulate a SH3, SH4 or SH4A processor.  
The type of processor and its options are controlled at config time.  
A huge part of the code is generated auto-magically by the lua code in `auto`; this allows for automatic generation of documentation, instruction implementation code, decoder code and assembler code.  
Configuration is done by editing `auto/constants.lua`  
Makefile is generated by executing `auto/auto.lua`  
Cleaning is done by executing `auto/clean.lua`  

# ToDo list
* move common flags to their own variables to speed things up
* and make SR load and store work based on the spec
* implement all instructions  
* finish the auto system  
* finish the Makefile builder  
* make it a shared object instead of a static library  
* and carefully pick exported functions 
* make an `install` target  
* implement the processor correctly  
* implement peripherals according to the spec  
* implement assembler and disassembler  
* implement a debugger
